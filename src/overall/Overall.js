                I am a mean stack developer with 3+ years of development experience using technologies like Angular and Nodejs. My work includes creating responsive websites, implementing framework related components that can be reused in the application,
    creating Rest api's using express and modelling data using Mongodb. Time to time i have used reactjs to create components for vanilla js projects. I have managed codebases using Git and deployed them in
    heroku and firebase.
